# typeson-registry

## Version 1.0.0

- Breaking and other changes: Upgraded version of Typeson from 3.0.0 to 5.1.0

- Breaking change: Make `SpecialNumber` a preset consisting of new
    individual types for `NaN`, `Infinity`, `-Infinity`

- Fix: Use new `Typeson.toStringTag` and `Typeson.hasConstructorOf` to
    get cross-frame/cross-module class detection (replacing `constructor`
    and `instanceof` checks)

- Fix (RegExp): Get `regexp` type to work properly with `multiline`
- Fix (RegExp): Add `unicode` and `sticky` flag support for cloning
- Fix (Date): Support invalid dates (with `NaN` value)
- Fix (undefined/sparseUndefined): Label `undefined` at root as regular
    `undefined` rather than `sparseUndefined` (will rely on update to
    `typeson`)
- Fix (SCA): Remove `Proxy` from list of structured clone throwing to throw
    as not available as such
- Fix (DataView): Get `dataview` to properly encode and decode `buffer`
    property
- Fix (ImageData): Get `imagedata` type to work properly (as `data` is not
    an array proper and length is on prototype, the object iteration
    will not preserve); fix by converting to array and reconstructing
    `Uint8ClampedArray` during revival)
- Fix (TypedArrays): For sake of TypedArrays, update to patched
    `base64-arraybuffer`

- Enhancement: Add cloneable type with test (detects/utilizes
    `__cloneEncapsulate` and `__cloneRevive` methods on an object)
- Enhancement: Add resurrectable type with test (resurrects non-plain
    objects, functions, and symbols to the exact instance, assuming the
    same session/environment)
- Enhancement: Add `ImageBitmap` type (with sync and async revival)
- Enhancement: Add `File`, `Blob`, and `FileList` types (with sync and
    async replacement/encapsulation)
- Enhancement: Add `user-objects` type and utilize in structured cloning
    to allow for non-plain user objects to be cloned; add test
- Enhancement: Add `nonbuiltin-ignore` type to roughly detect non-builtin
    objects and avoid adding them as properties
- Enhancement (minor): Check `typeof` for functions in SCA since can avoid
    false positives

- Refactoring: Rely on now Typeson-built-in `isUserObject`
- Refactoring: Adjust to Typeson changes re: sparse arrays and `undefined`

- npm: Update dependencies and remove shrinkwrap
- npm/ignore files: Add `node-canvas` testing dependency and ignore
    resulting build directory

- Building: Create `dist` directories if not existing
- Building: Package all types/presets into one (browserified/uglified)
    file as well as to individual files
- Building: Uglify and build source maps (preserving source files)

- Test building: Add Windows-specific routine for copying node-canvas DLLs
- Testing: Partial `URL.createObjectURL` polyfill
- Testing: Add browser testing support
- Testing: Make `Intl` locale result consistent
- Testing: Add `universal` preset tests
- Testing: Run built-in tests once with individual type(s) and once with
    the preset
- Testing: Add watch routine for CI development; add preliminary babelify
    routine to support more advanced features in test source (if not code)
- Testing: Add `ImageData` test that works in Node
- Testing: Add tests for missing untested types
- Testing: Add a property and prototype property to simulated built in
    class
- Testing: Add user objects test; simplify non-built-in test
- Testing: Provide simple `server.js` (run by default with `npm start`)
    to avoid Chrome origin restrictions when run on file system
- Testing: Restore `undefined` at root
- Testing (Workers): Display results on HTML page
- Testing (Workers): Elaborate more on logging
- Testing (Update): JSDom API usage; overcome apparent Mocha change with
    deep equal, bump some timeouts, get working fully with in-browser test
- Testing (Refactoring): move utils into own file; use
    polyfill form of `Array.from`; avoid setting globals; create entry
    file without Canvas-specific code (problem when browserified)
- Testing (Refactoring): Consistent indentation and var. naming, reorder tests
    as present in built-in preset

- Demos: Remove redundant references to Typeson (already bundled with dist
    files)
- Docs (Code comment): imagedata no longer needs `arraybuffer.js` and can
    be shimmed in Node via `node-canvas`
- Docs (README): Demonstrate function revival (but indicate caveats and
    do not bundle)
- Docs (README): Indicate node-canvas build requirements for tests
- Docs (README): Add more info and usage notes for types and presets

## Version 1.0.0-alpha.2

- Fix (SCA): Structured cloning algorithm (SCA) should also throw upon
    encountering the `arguments` exotic object
- Fix (SCA): Prohibit `Object.prototype` as it is an exotic object and
    therefore per SCA ought to be rejected (though not forbidden currently
    in Chrome)
- Fix (SCA): Prevent final built-in non-array exotic object (`Module`)
    that should throw with SCA
- Fix (SCA): Throw upon DOM nodes (common non-built-in exotic? objects that
    cannot be cloned)
- Fix (ImageData): Check that `ImageData` is even defined; e.g., not in Node
    without node-canvas (it is not so critical, at least for structured cloning,
    to cause failures by its absence)
- Doc: Add to code comments re: exotic objects

## Version 1.0.0-alpha.1

- Enhancement (SCA): Add preliminary structured-cloning export with additional
    exception throwing checker (implemented as a typeson `test`)
- Enhancement (undefined/builtin): Add `undefined` type (overcomes JSON
    limitations representing `undefined`) and also add to `builtin` preset
- Enhancement (sparseUndefined): Add a new `sparseUndefined` type to allow
    rebuilding of sparse arrays (without explicit `undefined`)
- Refactoring: Adjust `undefined` behavior per new `typeson` behavior: ensure
    an explicit `undefined` will be added by reviver where justified
- Clean-up: Remove trailing WS, consistent semi-colon usage
- Clean-up: Make HTML proper HTML5 (and avoid browser messages)
- npm: Add authorship/contributors
- Testing: Add Structured Cloning tests (of both kinds)
- Testing: Add `undefined` and `sparseUndefined` tests (will require new
    published version of typeson)
- Docs: Fix typos in code comments
- Docs (README:) Fix headings (and use list style that doesn't trip up
    poor syntax highlighters which don't distinguish with bold)
